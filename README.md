# Experiment 5: Forking, Cloning, and Pull Requests  

This repository is used to demonstrate **GitHub workflow basics**: forking, cloning, making changes, pushing, and creating a pull request.  

## Steps Performed  

### 1. Forking a Repository  
- Forked the public repository `octocat/Spoon-Knife` on GitHub.  
- Now the fork is available under my account (`prati-1011/Spoon-Knife`).  

### 2. Cloning the Fork  
- Cloned the fork to my local machine using:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/prati-1011/Spoon-Knife.git
